<h4>Project Synopsis</h4>
<p>
The rise of stay home working culture and the proliferation of delivery services have seen a rise in the emergence of food platforms. At present, they are divided into two camps: The tingkat home delivery and the order on demand platforms. There exists an opportunity that the two operating models can be merged. We hereby present: tingkat panda.
</p>

<h4>Project Phases</h4>
<p>
This project will run through the following phases:

Ideation
Wireframing
Visual Design
Requirements Gathering
Information Architecture / Database Design
System Design
Implementation
Testing
Integration

Due to the short nature of this project and the fact that we only have 2 team members sans our advisor, we have decided to work based on an iterative model. We will go through iteration #1 where our chief aim is to complete our skeletal application and then iteration #2 where we will aim to complete a bare bones working prototype.</p>
